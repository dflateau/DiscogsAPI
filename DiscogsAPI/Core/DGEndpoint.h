 Discogs HTTP error code.
 
 - DGErrorCodeUnauthorized: You’re attempting to access a resource that first requires authentication.
 - DGErrorCodeForbidden: You’re not allowed to access this resource. Even if you authenticated, or already have, you simply don’t have permission. Trying to modify another user’s profile, for example, will produce this error.
 - DGErrorCodeNotFound: The resource you requested doesn’t exist.
 - DGErrorCodeMethodNotAllowed: You’re trying to use an HTTP verb that isn’t supported by the resource. Trying to PUT to /artists/1, for example, will fail because Artists are read-only.
 - DGErrorCodeUnprocessableEntity: Your request was well-formed, but there’s something semantically wrong with the body of the request. This can be due to malformed JSON, a parameter that’s missing or the wrong type, or trying to perform an action that doesn’t make any sense. Check the response body for specific information about what went wrong.
 - DGErrorCodeInternalServerError: Something went wrong on our end while attempting to process your request. The response body’s message field will contain an error code that you can send to Discogs Support (which will help us track down your specific issue).
